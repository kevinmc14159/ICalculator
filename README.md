# ICalculator
ICalculator is a simple Java program that calculates the value of your investments over time. ICalculator uses four pieces of information:

* Principal - the initial amount put into an investment
* Years - the length of time the investment has to grow
* Interest - the compound interest rate at which your investments will grow
* Contribution - the monthly contribution you make to your investments

For every year, ICalculator adds the total yearly contribution to the current value of the investments and applies the interest rate to the total. The total amount after the given time period is displayed to the user.

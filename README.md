# ICalculator
ICalculator is a simple Java program that calculates the value of your investments over time. ICalculator uses four pieces of information:

* Principal - the initial amount put into an investment
* Years - the length of time the investment has to grow
* Interest - the compound interest rate at which your investments will grow
* Contribution - the monthly contribution you make to your investments

ICalculator uses these four pieces of information to calculate the expected value of your investments at the end of the time frame.
